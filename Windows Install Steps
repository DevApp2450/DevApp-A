Windows Install Steps:

If a command doesn't work, restart your CMD Prompt or log out and back in, as env variables need to update.  You may need to set some env variables yourself.

If git isn't already installed, install it: 
Select the command prompt option: http://git-scm.com/download/win 
Optional but nice: https://windows.github.com/
you should be able to open cmd prompt and type "git --version"

Install nodejs: http://nodejs.org

Clone DevApp-A with Git: https://github.com/DevApp2450/DevApp-A

Navigate to DevApp folder

npm install -d
npm install -g bower
bower install
npm install -g grunt-cli
grunt serve
